## OOP in TD Concepts

- Base Comp or Container is a class
  - Customize w/parameters
  - Parexec (*)
  - op()/ops() - query nodes like document.querySelector() in .js
  - Global op references are singletons or clone masters. Should only be at top level
- Cloning & replicators
  - Replilcator is like a for() loop that creates a bunch of objects from a class definition
  - Clones are like instances of a class, generally sprinkled throughout a project
- Externalizing .tox & .py files 
	- Comp + .py extension = class
  - for git tracking & easy access in VS Code
  - externalized python is one step closer to normal AI-assisted dev workflows
 	- python relative external file path to tox: `parent().par.externaltox.eval().replace('.tox', '.py')`
- Python extensions
	- Class per comp/container
  	- Can handle lifecycle events
  	- execute dat traditionally handles some of this
  - Python -> nodes -> Python flow
    - Last node is a chopexec that calls back into the class
  - No floating chopexec scripts!
  - Logic in python, numeric operations in CHOPs
  - Dependable properties
  - /project1 gets an App extension w/global op ref
- Bootstrap App extension
  - .env vars
  - shell env vars
  - Launch app w/shell script, reliably
- External python modules - now w/ pyEnvManager
- Autosave w/dirty tox detection
- AppStore (w/socket server) - look at Zoox example
  - Store paths to shared nodes
- Refactoring
- Probably not for today
  - ML tools in TD
  - Threading
